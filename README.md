```
As a web user
So that I can easily find web pages
I want to see a list of titles and addresses of my favourite pages in an online app

As a web user
So that I can quickly find pages I have visited most recently
I want to see a list of link displayed in reverse chronological order

As a web user
So that  I can remember new pages I visit
I want to be able to add additional links to the app

As a web user
So that I can categorise the pages I visit
I want to be able to add zero or more tags to a link that I store in the app

As a web user
So that I can easily find web pages of interest
I want to be able to filter the display of pages by one or more tags
